## Overview

**Go** **W**atch: missing watch mode for the `go` command. It's invoked exactly like `go`, but also watches Go files and reruns on changes.

Currently requires Unix (MacOS, Linux, BSD). On Windows, runs under WSL.

## Why

Why not other runners, general-purpose watchers, etc:

* Go-specific, easy to remember.
* Has hotkeys, such as `ctrl+r` to restart! (Opt-in via `-r`.)
* Ignores non-Go files by default.
* Better watcher: recursive, no delays, no polling; uses https://github.com/rjeczalik/notify.
* Silent by default. (Opt-in logging via `-v`.)
* No garbage files.
* Properly clears the terminal on restart. (Opt-in via `-c`.)
* Does not leak subprocesses.
* Minimal dependencies.

## Installation

Make sure you have Go installed, then run this:

```sh
go install github.com/mitranim/gow@latest
```

This should download the source and compile the executable into `$GOPATH/bin/gow`. Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH` so the shell can discover the `gow` command. For example, my `~/.profile` contains this:

```sh
export GOPATH="$HOME/go"
export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"
```

Alternatively, you can run the executable using the full path. At the time of writing, `~/go` is the default `$GOPATH` for Go installations. Some systems may have a different one.

```sh
~/go/bin/gow
```

On MacOS, if installation fails with dylib-related errors, you may need to run `xcode-select --install` or install Xcode. This is caused by `gow`'s dependencies, which depend on C. See [#15](https://github.com/mitranim/gow/issues/15).

## Usage

The first argument to `gow`, after the flags, can be any Go subcommand: `build`, `install`, `tool`, you name it.

```sh
# Start and restart on change
gow run .

# Pass args to the program
gow run . arg0 arg1 ...

# Run subdirectory
gow run ./subdir

# Vet and re-vet on change; verbose mode is recommended
gow -v vet

# Clear terminal on restart
gow -c run .

# Specify file extension to watch
gow -e=go,mod,html run .

# Enable hotkey support
gow -v -r vet

# Help
gow -h
```

## Hotkeys

The flag `-r` enables hotkey support. Should be used in interactive terminals at the top level, but should be avoided in non-interactive environments (e.g. containers) and when running multiple `gow` concurrently (e.g. orchestrated via Make).

This mode is only available in a TTY. In this mode, the subprocess is _not_ considered to be in a TTY, and cannot read stdin. Avoid it for programs which need to be interactive by reading user input from stdin.

Supported control codes with commonly associated hotkeys. Exact keys may vary between terminal apps. For example, `^-` in MacOS Terminal vs `^?` in iTerm2.

```
3     ^C          Kill subprocess with SIGINT.
18    ^R          Kill subprocess with SIGTERM, restart.
20    ^T          Kill subprocess with SIGTERM.
28    ^\          Kill subprocess with SIGQUIT.
31    ^- or ^?    Print currently running command.
8     ^H          Print help.
127   ^H (MacOS)  Print help.
```

In slightly more technical terms, `gow` switches the terminal into [raw mode](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Serial_Programming/termios), reads from stdin, interprets some ASCII control codes, and forwards the other input to the subprocess as-is. In raw mode, pressing one of these hotkeys causes a terminal to write the corresponding byte to stdin, which is then interpreted by `gow`.

See the example [`makefile`](makefile) for how to detect if we're about to run one or more `gow`, and enabling raw mode only when safe.

## Configuration

At present, `gow` _does not_ support config files. All configuration is done through CLI flags. This is suitable for small, simple projects. Larger projects typically use a build tool such as Make, which is also sufficient for managing the configuration of `gow`. See the example [`makefile`](makefile).

## Scripting

`gow` invokes an arbitrary executable; by default it invokes `go` which should be installed globally. For some advanced use cases, you may need a custom script. For example, if you want `gow` to run `go generate` before any other `go` operation, create a local shell script `go.sh`:

```sh
touch go.sh
chmod +x go.sh
```

...with the following content:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

go generate &&
go $@
```

To invoke it, use `-g` when running `gow`:

```sh
gow -g=./go.sh -v -c run .
```

Alternatively, instead of creating script files, you can write recipes in a makefile; see [Configuration](#configuration) and the example [`makefile`](makefile).

## Gotchas

Enabling hotkeys via `-r` involves switching the terminal into "raw mode"; see [1](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Serial_Programming/termios). As a result, this is _only_ viable when:

* You run `gow` in an interactive terminal.
* There is only one instance of `gow` in this terminal tab.
* There are no other processes in this tab that use raw mode; examples:
  * Editors such as `nano`/`vim`/`emacs`.
  * Another `gow` with `-r`.
* The subprocess does not need to read from stdin.

In Docker, or in any other non-interactive environment, `-r` may produce errors related to terminal state. Examples:

```
> unable to read terminal state
> inappropriate ioctl for device
> operation not supported by device
```

There should be only one `gow -r` per terminal tab. When running multiple `gow` processes in one terminal tab, most should be `gow -r=false`. `gow` processes do not coordinate. If several are attempting to modify the terminal state (from cooked mode to raw mode, then restore), due to a race condition, they may end up "restoring" the wrong state, leaving the terminal in the raw mode at the end.

See [`makefile`](makefile), particularly the variable `GOW_HOTKEYS`, for how to detect concurrent execution of multiple tasks, and avoid enabling hotkeys / raw mode.

When `gow` runs in raw mode, the subprocess's stdin is always empty, immediately closed (EOF), and is not a TTY.

## Watching Templates

Many Go programs, such as servers, include template files, and want to recompile those templates on change.

Easy but slow way: use `gow -e`.

```sh
gow -e=go,mod,html run .
```

This restarts your entire app on change to any `.html` file in the current directory or sub-directories. Beware: if the app also generates files with the same extensions, this could cause an infinite restart loop. Ignore any output directories with `-i`:

```sh
gow -e=go,mod,html -i=target run .
```

A smarter approach would be to watch the template files from _inside_ the app and recompile them without restarting the entire app. This is out of scope for `gow`.

Finally, you can use a pure-Go rendering system such as [github.com/mitranim/gax](https://github.com/mitranim/gax).

## Alternatives

For general purpose file watching, consider these excellent tools:
* https://github.com/mattgreen/watchexec
* https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch

## TODO

* Use GitHub Actions to automatically build executables. Research how to publish to various package managers.
* Investigate switching from `golang.org/x/sys/unix` to `golang.org/x/term`, which is higher-level and supports Windows. This may allow `gow` to work on Windows.
  * Tried, seems to break stdio.
* Consider having a flag that takes a string and writes that string to the subprocess stdin on each subprocess start.
  * Or better: read our own stdin on startup, buffer it, and pass it to the subproc every time.
* Consider using `https://github.com/creack/pty` to allocate a pseudo-terminal for the subprocess when raw mode is enabled _and_ we're in a TTY, then forward any unhandled stdin to the subprocess.
  * Tried, didn't work.
* Consider intercepting interrupt in non-raw mode, similar to raw mode.
  * Forgot why, probably unnecessary.
* Add a hotkey that parses subprocess output, looking for what looks like file paths with optional rows and columns, and opens the first, then the next, and so on.
